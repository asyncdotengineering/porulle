### Minor Changes

- [#160](https://github.com/asyncdotengineering/porulle/pull/160) [`97dbe39`](https://github.com/asyncdotengineering/porulle/commit/97dbe39674692ea9dbf66df7645b58d727ab3da7) Thanks [@octalpixel](https://github.com/octalpixel)! - **BREAKING.** Removes dead and pass-through surface found by a deletion-test audit, and fixes the bugs that duplication was hiding. Full removal → replacement tables: `docs/migration-0.64-to-0.65.md`.

  Fixes:

  - Webhooks now deliver for `customers.*`, `pricing.*`, `promotions.*`, `inventory.update`, `fulfillment.create` and `cart.addItem`; those modules enqueued into a no-op job queue. `catalog.delete` and `pricing.update` are now emitted at all (their hooks were registered but never fired), so their webhooks and audit entries appear too.
  - `auth.twoFactor.requiredForRoles` is enforced: a member of a listed role (including a composite role such as `"owner,admin"`) without 2FA gets `403 TWO_FACTOR_REQUIRED`, and booting with required roles while two-factor is disabled throws.
  - `adapter-tax-manual` subtracts `orderDiscount` from the taxable base.
  - `import-shopify` / `import-woocommerce` import the whole catalogue (not the first 250 / 100 products) and no longer multiply zero-decimal currencies by 100.
  - Email adapters' default templates escape caller data.
  - `formatAmount`, invoices and receipts honour zero-decimal currencies.
  - Marketplace sub-order errors answer 422 / 404 instead of 500; PGlite transactions queue instead of interleaving, and a call joins only the transaction whose body it runs in.
  - The built-in drizzle jobs engine rejects unknown task slugs at enqueue, like the other engines.

  Removed:

  - `@porulle/db` (use `pgTable` from `@porulle/core/drizzle`), `@porulle/sdk/react` and `createSDK`, the CLI's `migrate`, `generate migration` and `deploy`.
  - From `@porulle/core`: `defineModule` and the module types, `createRepository`, `QueryRegistry` / `executeQuery`, the `access*` combinators, `toHttpError`, the `LocalAPI` class, `canAccessCart`, `BUILTIN_JOB_TASK_SLUGS`, `getTableNames`, `reuseOrCreateTxContext`, `ServiceRegistry`, `CommerceModuleTypes`, `HookRegistry#emit` / `#setLogger` / `#prependInTransaction`, `webhooks.enqueueDelivery`, `analytics.getDashboard` / `.meta()`, `tax.requireConfigured()`, `config.database.options`, `createHookContext`'s `kernel` argument, and `createSystemActor`'s default organization.
  - From `@porulle/core/testing`: `createRepositoryTestHarness`, `createTestPluginContext`, `beforeHook`, `afterHook`.
  - Plugin options nothing read (18 across marketplace, appointments and POS), marketplace contract pricing (its routes and the `marketplace_contract_prices` table), and POS's `createPOSPaymentAdapter`.

  Added: `createTestActor`, `renderEmail`, `escapeHtml`, `currencyExponent`, `toMinorUnits`, `formatAmount`, `prepareEnqueue`, `createPGliteTransaction`, `normalizeExecuteShape`, `CommerceTwoFactorRequiredError`.

### Minor Changes

- Fix six defects reported by an adopter integrating the published packages.

  **Catalog read endpoints now require `catalog:read`.** An unauthenticated caller could read any catalog entity by id and receive the full record, including `organizationId` and including entities in `draft` with `isVisible: false` — cross-tenant disclosure of unpublished merchant data in the documented one-organization-per-merchant posture. Entity, category and brand reads are guarded, and entity-by-id lookups are organization-scoped so an authenticated caller cannot read another organization's record either. Storefronts are unaffected: an anonymous visitor resolved through `storeResolver` receives the customer permission set, which grants `catalog:read`. That coupling is now pinned by a test, since dropping `catalog:read` from the customer defaults would silently 401 every public storefront.

  **Password sign-up failed on a fresh install.** better-auth 1.7 writes an `issuer` column to `account` that porulle's schema did not declare, so its Drizzle adapter built an INSERT against a column the migration did not know about. The column and its migration are added, the better-auth dependencies are aligned to the range actually installed, and a parity guard derived from better-auth's own `getAuthTables()` — not a hand-maintained field list — now fails the build if the declared schema drifts from what better-auth writes.

  **Seven packages published an entry point that did not exist.** `@porulle/adapter-meilisearch`, `@porulle/adapter-pg-search`, `@porulle/adapter-r2`, `@porulle/adapter-s3`, `@porulle/import-flat`, `@porulle/import-shopify` and `@porulle/import-woocommerce` declared `./dist/index.js` while their build emitted `dist/src/index.js`, so importing any of them threw. Each was missing `"rootDir": "src"` in its build config.

  **The CLI binary is now `porulle`**, matching every documented command; `unifiedcommerce` remains as an alias so existing invocations keep working.

  **`@porulle/adapter-local-storage` rejoins the release train**, so `@porulle/*` can be pinned to a single version. It had been excluded and left at 0.10.7 while the family moved on — which also broke `porulle init`, since the scaffolded project pins every `@porulle/*` dependency to the CLI's own version and the starter template imports the local-storage adapter.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- Catalog data-quality primitives, lossless channel import, and the outbound catalog contract.

  **Catalog.** Custom-field values are now updatable and carry provenance: `source`, `status` (proposed/approved/rejected), `confidence`, `evidence`, `locale`, and approval stamps, with one approved value per (entity, field, locale). A review workflow ships whole: approve/reject endpoints that displace the live value atomically and preserve evidence, an org-scoped proposal queue, and `?include=customFields` on entity reads returning approved rows. `select` fields enforce their declared options exact-match. Runtime entity field definitions layer over code config with admin REST and archive-never-delete semantics. Every catalog mutation writes a full entity revision in the same transaction, with true restore, per-entity monotonic numbering, and org-scoped retention trim. Media assets carry an origin (merchant/generated/imported) with a derivation link, and entity-media uniqueness is enforced per level.

  **Search.** `SearchFilters.attributes` and `SearchDocument.attributes` add attribute filtering and facets (AND across names, OR within one), opt-in per field via `filterable`, indexing approved values only — implemented in the in-memory engine, `adapter-pg-search` (parameterized jsonb), and `adapter-meilisearch` (union-safe filterable settings). The REST search route accepts repeatable `attr.<name>` parameters with an allowlisted grammar.

  **Channels.** `ChannelCatalogItem` widens to the full catalog shape — per-locale attributes, images, option axes, tags, brand, categories, status, and variant prices with compare-at — while staying structurally unable to express checkout state. Both connectors import the full payloads their platforms return, with currency-gated minor-unit prices. Convergence writes real catalog tables idempotently and merges metadata per key. A resumable per-store backfill (REST, durable job, and `porulle channel:backfill`) upgrades catalogs imported before this release. Per-field catalog ownership (`platform`/`store`/`shared`) with deterministic precedence governs every inbound path, holding shared conflicts persistently; connecting a store never implies catalog write access, and per-store placement mappings resolve at read time over provider defaults. The `ChannelConnector` contract gains an optional `pushCatalog` capability with intent-based payloads, per-item outcomes with prior remote values, and a platform-owned-only assembly — the write paths land in a following release.

  Consumer migrations for the schema additions are documented per feature in the repository's `docs/migration-*.md` files. PostgreSQL 15+ is now required.

### Minor Changes

- Resolve admin-panel API gaps ([#33](https://github.com/asyncdotengineering/porulle/issues/33)–[#38](https://github.com/asyncdotengineering/porulle/issues/38)):

  - **Pricing**: `setBasePrice` now upserts on the natural key instead of appending a duplicate row, and `?include=pricing` exposes `id` + `createdAt` so consumers can identify the authoritative price.
  - **CSRF**: the global `csrf()` guard is skipped for API-key / bearer (server-to-server) requests, and genuine origin rejections surface a distinguishable `CSRF_ORIGIN_REJECTED` code.
  - **Catalog media**: `?include=media` is now backed by a real media/entity link lookup (role, sortOrder, url) instead of always returning `[]`.
  - **Local storage adapter / starter**: the `/assets/*` `serveStatic` mount strips the `/assets` prefix so adapter-generated URLs resolve correctly.
  - **Orders**: new REST endpoints for draft/manual order creation (`POST /orders`), payment capture (`POST /orders/{id}/capture`), and refund (`POST /orders/{id}/refund`).
  - **Variants**: `/variants/generate` documents its request body and returns a `422` for a missing/invalid strategy instead of a `500`.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#32](https://github.com/asyncdotengineering/porulle/pull/32) [`dcc4fe9`](https://github.com/asyncdotengineering/porulle/commit/dcc4fe98a476ae91d12a13495db20fe2e7d5dd2e) Thanks [@octalpixel](https://github.com/octalpixel)! - `init` now pins scaffolded `@porulle/*` dependencies to the version of the CLI that created the project. The packages ship as a fixed-version group, so the running CLI's own version is the correct, coherent target; previously the starter template carried a static range (`^0.5.0`) that went stale on every release and — under 0.x caret semantics — left freshly scaffolded projects a full minor behind the CLI.
