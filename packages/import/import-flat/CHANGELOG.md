# @porulle/import-flat

## 0.12.0

### Patch Changes

- Fix six defects reported by an adopter integrating the published packages.

  **Catalog read endpoints now require `catalog:read`.** An unauthenticated caller could read any catalog entity by id and receive the full record, including `organizationId` and including entities in `draft` with `isVisible: false` — cross-tenant disclosure of unpublished merchant data in the documented one-organization-per-merchant posture. Entity, category and brand reads are guarded, and entity-by-id lookups are organization-scoped so an authenticated caller cannot read another organization's record either. Storefronts are unaffected: an anonymous visitor resolved through `storeResolver` receives the customer permission set, which grants `catalog:read`. That coupling is now pinned by a test, since dropping `catalog:read` from the customer defaults would silently 401 every public storefront.

  **Password sign-up failed on a fresh install.** better-auth 1.7 writes an `issuer` column to `account` that porulle's schema did not declare, so its Drizzle adapter built an INSERT against a column the migration did not know about. The column and its migration are added, the better-auth dependencies are aligned to the range actually installed, and a parity guard derived from better-auth's own `getAuthTables()` — not a hand-maintained field list — now fails the build if the declared schema drifts from what better-auth writes.

  **Seven packages published an entry point that did not exist.** `@porulle/adapter-meilisearch`, `@porulle/adapter-pg-search`, `@porulle/adapter-r2`, `@porulle/adapter-s3`, `@porulle/import-flat`, `@porulle/import-shopify` and `@porulle/import-woocommerce` declared `./dist/index.js` while their build emitted `dist/src/index.js`, so importing any of them threw. Each was missing `"rootDir": "src"` in its build config.

  **The CLI binary is now `porulle`**, matching every documented command; `unifiedcommerce` remains as an alias so existing invocations keep working.

  **`@porulle/adapter-local-storage` rejoins the release train**, so `@porulle/*` can be pinned to a single version. It had been excluded and left at 0.10.7 while the family moved on — which also broke `porulle init`, since the scaffolded project pins every `@porulle/*` dependency to the CLI's own version and the starter template imports the local-storage adapter.
