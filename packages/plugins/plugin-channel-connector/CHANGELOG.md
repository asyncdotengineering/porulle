### Patch Changes

- [`d56b71b`](https://github.com/asyncdotengineering/porulle/commit/d56b71b340d3b9a69cca0af7144953db6f635ba3) Thanks [@octalpixel](https://github.com/octalpixel)! - **Breaking:** `resolveOrgId` no longer consults the boot-time `auth.defaultOrganizationId` before strict resolution. An actor-less call with strict org resolution enabled now throws `OrgResolutionError` where it previously resolved to the configured default organization.

  Explicit `defaultOrgId` arguments and actor `organizationId` are unchanged. Set `auth.strictOrgResolution: false` or `STRICT_ORG_RESOLUTION=false` to restore the previous behaviour where the boot default answers actor-less calls.

  `resolveOrgIdForCommerce(actor, config)` is the sanctioned migration path for callers that hold `CommerceConfig`. Hand-built `HookContext` values should thread `commerceConfig`; without it, an orgless actor throws under strict resolution.

  Published plugin packages now use the same config-aware organization resolution, including checkout hooks and plugin routes, so upgrading core and these plugins together preserves actor-less requests on deployments that declare a default organization.

### Minor Changes

- Complete the outbound catalog push path: Porulle can now write catalog data back to a connected store, not only read from it.

  **Both adapters implement `pushCatalog`.** Shopify writes native product fields and metafields in a Porulle-owned namespace, adds the `write_products` scope, and resolves push capability per store from the scopes that store actually granted — a store connected before the scope existed fails closed with a non-retriable error naming the re-authorisation route rather than 403ing forever. WooCommerce writes native fields, `meta_data` under a Porulle prefix, and global `pa_*` taxonomy attributes for fields marked filterable, since only those drive layered navigation. Both resolve placement from the payload's intent plus its remote key, and neither will guess a remote key it was not given.

  Three WooCommerce write semantics are handled explicitly because getting them wrong destroys merchant data: the product `attributes` array is replaced wholesale on update, so it is read-merge-written; underscore-prefixed meta keys are rerouted by WooCommerce to first-class property setters, so the Porulle prefix is enforced structurally; and the batch endpoint reports per-item failures inside an HTTP 200, so its body is parsed rather than its status trusted. Image pushes carry the imported attachment id and merge against the current gallery instead of rebuilding it.

  **Catalog writes are triggered, previewable, and reversible by a human.** A change to a platform-owned field enqueues a push for the stores that map the entity, skipping writes that originated from channel convergence so an import cannot bounce straight back out. `POST /api/channels/stores/:id/push-catalog/preview` returns the per-field diff a push would apply, assembled by the same builder the job uses, and distinguishes a remote value that is absent from one that was never read.

  **A shared field that changes on both sides now waits for a person.** Convergence holds the field, records both values, and surfaces the conflict for review at `GET /api/channels/conflicts`; resolving it applies the chosen value without reassigning ownership, so the field stays shared and can conflict again.

### Minor Changes

- Catalog data-quality primitives, lossless channel import, and the outbound catalog contract.

  **Catalog.** Custom-field values are now updatable and carry provenance: `source`, `status` (proposed/approved/rejected), `confidence`, `evidence`, `locale`, and approval stamps, with one approved value per (entity, field, locale). A review workflow ships whole: approve/reject endpoints that displace the live value atomically and preserve evidence, an org-scoped proposal queue, and `?include=customFields` on entity reads returning approved rows. `select` fields enforce their declared options exact-match. Runtime entity field definitions layer over code config with admin REST and archive-never-delete semantics. Every catalog mutation writes a full entity revision in the same transaction, with true restore, per-entity monotonic numbering, and org-scoped retention trim. Media assets carry an origin (merchant/generated/imported) with a derivation link, and entity-media uniqueness is enforced per level.

  **Search.** `SearchFilters.attributes` and `SearchDocument.attributes` add attribute filtering and facets (AND across names, OR within one), opt-in per field via `filterable`, indexing approved values only — implemented in the in-memory engine, `adapter-pg-search` (parameterized jsonb), and `adapter-meilisearch` (union-safe filterable settings). The REST search route accepts repeatable `attr.<name>` parameters with an allowlisted grammar.

  **Channels.** `ChannelCatalogItem` widens to the full catalog shape — per-locale attributes, images, option axes, tags, brand, categories, status, and variant prices with compare-at — while staying structurally unable to express checkout state. Both connectors import the full payloads their platforms return, with currency-gated minor-unit prices. Convergence writes real catalog tables idempotently and merges metadata per key. A resumable per-store backfill (REST, durable job, and `porulle channel:backfill`) upgrades catalogs imported before this release. Per-field catalog ownership (`platform`/`store`/`shared`) with deterministic precedence governs every inbound path, holding shared conflicts persistently; connecting a store never implies catalog write access, and per-store placement mappings resolve at read time over provider defaults. The `ChannelConnector` contract gains an optional `pushCatalog` capability with intent-based payloads, per-item outcomes with prior remote values, and a platform-owned-only assembly — the write paths land in a following release.

  Consumer migrations for the schema additions are documented per feature in the repository's `docs/migration-*.md` files. PostgreSQL 15+ is now required.

- [#77](https://github.com/asyncdotengineering/porulle/pull/77) [`22e0be4`](https://github.com/asyncdotengineering/porulle/commit/22e0be4eca991f78aed7f458306a399c9dc7c8ce) Thanks [@octalpixel](https://github.com/octalpixel)! - Add Shopify and WooCommerce catalog synchronization plus paid order injection with transparent customer shipping details, remote status confirmation, and tiered failed-export handling.

- [#77](https://github.com/asyncdotengineering/porulle/pull/77) [`8f8c564`](https://github.com/asyncdotengineering/porulle/commit/8f8c564deb399a86c50d27d8ca07e5334888bf30) Thanks [@octalpixel](https://github.com/octalpixel)! - Add generic one-click store onboarding: Shopify OAuth and WooCommerce `/wc-auth` endpoint flows via new engine-plugin routes (`/api/channels/oauth/{provider}/start` + `/callback`), signed single-use callback state, and connector `buildAuthUrl`/`completeAuth` methods — alongside the existing credential-paste path. Add Shopify mandatory GDPR compliance webhook ingress: `POST /api/channels/compliance/{provider}` unauthenticated route, app-secret HMAC verification (`verifyAppWebhook`), `shop_domain` store resolution, and idempotent dispatch to existing redaction methods (`customers/data_request`, `customers/redact`, `shop/redact`).
